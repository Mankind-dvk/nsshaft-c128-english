# NS-SHAFT C128 source architecture

## Design choice

The project uses a subsystem-oriented, single-translation-unit ca65 layout.
`src/main.s` is the only assembler entry point and includes the other source
modules. This keeps the fixed C128 memory map and ca65 cheap-local labels simple,
while separating code by responsibility.

A fully independent object-file architecture would require every shared byte and
routine to be exported/imported. For this small 6502 game that adds interface
boilerplate without reducing runtime coupling. The include-module pattern keeps
the same generated machine code while making ownership and call flow explicit.

## Source map

The rows are grouped by game subsystem, not by the literal `.include` order in
`main.s`. `assets.inc` includes `charset.inc`, which in turn includes the two
source charsets and `charset_loader.inc`.

| World and hazards | `src/conveyor_platforms.inc` | Left/right texture animation, vertical fragments and full-texture restoration |
| World and hazards | `src/health.inc` | Every-third-point HP reward, HUD rendering, spike/top damage recovery |
| Audio | `src/music.inc` | PAL raster IRQ, three SID voices, instruments, frequency and pattern tables |
| Scoring and leaderboard | `src/score.inc` | First-landing platform score, row claim flags and difficulty scheduling |
| Scoring and leaderboard | `src/highscores.inc` | Top-five ranking, name entry and leaderboard screen |
| Scoring and leaderboard | `src/highscore_storage.inc` | Dual-slot disk load/save, validation and KERNAL environment preservation |

## Macro layer

`main.s` includes `constants.inc` then `macros.inc` before executable modules.
Uppercase macro calls expand inline; lowercase routines still use `jsr`/`jmp`.
The seven helpers cover immediate word stores, D018 selection, paired screen
writes, paired sprite-pointer writes, register-bit updates and raster IRQ ACK.
Each helper expands to a short instruction sequence; its contract documents
which registers and flags the caller must preserve.

`STORE_SCREEN_PAIR` and `STORE_SPRITE_POINTER` take A as input and preserve all CPU
registers and flags; the other helpers overwrite A and N/Z. Optional X/Y indices
are runtime inputs, whereas addresses, masks and offsets are compile-time inputs.
Color RAM writes, `active_screen`, MMU mapping and interrupt masking remain the
caller's responsibility. Read/modify/write helpers must not be used for IRQ
status registers or D011. The music IRQ still returns through the C128 KERNAL;
there is deliberately no PUSH/POP wrapper or replacement RTI sequence.

See `src/macros.inc` for the individual contracts and expanded instructions.

## Runtime call flow

`start` performs machine initialization once:

1. map C128 RAM bank 0 with I/O visible and snapshot KERNAL's zero-page state
   for later disk operations;
2. force visible VIC-IIe work to 1 MHz;
3. select VIC bank 0 and configure mixed hires/multicolor text with ECM disabled;
4. initialize paddle input;
5. silence any SID state left by the previous program;
6. initialize and load the persistent leaderboard; on load failure offer R to
   retry or FIRE to continue with the in-memory table;
7. display the title screen and preview Elien, Ember, and Wasser;
8. use POTX ranges to highlight a character and lock it with FIRE;
9. show the locked character facing left/right until POTX reaches the gameplay
   neutral range under `PRESS FIRE WHEN CHARACTER FACES YOU`;
10. require centered POTX at the second FIRE press and after release; off-center FIRE
   shows the selected hurt frame for at least 12 PAL frames.

`new_game` resets subsystem state in dependency order:

1. compose the game charset with display blanked, then clear both screen buffers,
   Color RAM and platform descriptions;
2. reset disappearing- and spring-platform state, then reset conveyor texture
   patterns/counter and install their runtime glyphs;
3. seed the PRNG, reset score/HP/claim state, and generate platforms;
4. draw the fixed UI, six-digit score and three-digit HP;
5. initialize POTX display;
6. create the player and direction indicator;
7. initialize the SID arrangement and install the raster IRQ;
8. copy the visible screen into the hidden buffer and enable the display.

`main_loop` targets one update sequence per PAL frame. If work misses raster 250,
polling waits for a later frame; it does not run catch-up updates:

1. wait for raster line 250;
2. sample POTX;
3. update the direction indicator and POTX digits;
4. update horizontal player movement;
5. update vertical physics and collision. First airborne contact with an unclaimed
   platform awards its point, updates HP/difficulty, and then handles that platform.
   Spring launches and spike bounces use upward motion. Ceiling/platform spikes
   consume HP when available; bottom exit requests game over regardless of HP;
6. update activated disappearing and compressed spring platforms, then call
   `update_conveyor_animation` independently of passenger or world-scroll state;
7. select the player animation frame and process game over;
8. add the current difficulty rate to the scroll phase accumulator; the maximum
   tier bypasses it and schedules a step on every update;
9. on a scheduled step, carry a supported player upward and check ceiling contact.
   On contact, handle damage and skip world scrolling for this step; otherwise
   advance the world one pixel. Process any resulting game-over request.

Point awards occur inside step 5. Every third point adds HP, capped at 255.
Scores 20/40/60/80 apply matching 1.25x/1.5x/1.75x/2x levels to scrolling and
the SID event sequencer; platform-type pools change at 5/10/20/40.

After game over, music stops before the name-entry/leaderboard flow. Qualifying
scores are inserted once and saved to alternating disk slots; failed saves stay
marked dirty for retry. FIRE returns to character selection. These pages use
the text charset with all game sprites disabled.

The music does not depend on completion of `main_loop`. VIC-IIe raster line 240
dispatches `music_raster_irq`, while the main loop synchronizes at line 250.
Keeping these lines separate prevents the IRQ from making the polling loop miss
its frame boundary. The C128 KERNAL hardware entry has already saved
A/X/Y and the MMU configuration, so the music handler acknowledges the VIC,
advances the music phase, and jumps directly to the KERNAL IRQ restore path at
`$ff33`. It deliberately does not call the normal KERNAL IRQ service, which
would process the raster IRQ as a system display interrupt and disturb sprites.
This also avoids tempo drops when a character-transition frame takes longer
than one display frame.

## Memory map

This table follows the game's subsystems rather than numeric address order. The
three sprite rows show the bitmap allocation in its original, expanded, and
fast-frame batches. Ranges are inclusive; score state listed inside `CODE` is
shown again only to locate it, not as additional allocated space.

| Subsystem | Range | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup | `$1c01-$1c0c` | BASIC 7 `SYS 7424` loader |
| Core and shared state | `$1d00-$25da` | Main loop, video, platform descriptions/rendering, HUD, score, tables and state (`CODE`) |
| Shared zero-page scratch | `$f7-$fe` | Four two-byte screen/color pointers; outside the PRG segments |
| Display buffers | `$0400-$07ff`, `$0c00-$0fff` | Screen buffers A and B; each contains its sprite pointers in the last eight bytes |
| Display color | `$d800-$dbff` | Shared VIC color RAM, not a PRG segment |
| Runtime charset | `$2800-$2a1f` | Writable 68-slot mixed-mode output charset; slots 22..39 free |
| Source charsets | `$4000-$47ff`, `$4800-$4fff` | Immutable graphics-only and uppercase-text source charsets, 2 KB each |
| Charset and material code | `$5000-$5360` | Material/collision tables, descriptor effect updates, conveyor animation and charset composition |
| **Sprite bitmaps, first batch** | **`$3000-$30ff`** | Elien normal, fall, right and left: four 64-byte frames (`SPRITE`) |
| **Sprite bitmaps, second batch** | **`$3a00-$3cbf`** | Elien hurt, then Ember's and Wasser's five normal/fall/right/left/hurt frames each: eleven 64-byte frames (`PLAYERSETS`) |
| **Sprite bitmaps, fast batch** | **`$3e80-$3fff`** | Elien, Ember and Wasser fast-left/fast-right: six 64-byte frames (`FASTSPRITES`) |
| Unused sprite block | `$3100-$313f` | Unused; HUD sprite 4 reuses the character bitmap blocks above |
| Character selection | `$3cc0-$3e6a` | Title selection, prompt text and frame/color lookup tables |
| Player physics | `$3140-$376d` | Player movement/collision, ceiling recovery and spring/conveyor routines |
| Platform effects | `$2e00-$2f2c` | Disappearing-platform effect routines |
| World and health | `$3800-$39da` | Ceiling drawing, weighted generation, HP display and spike recovery |
| Music | `$2a20-$2de2` | SID player, frequency tables and 16-bar arrangement |
| Score state within `CODE` | `$257b-$2580`, `$2587-$259a` | Six score digits and 20 per-row first-landing claim flags |
| Persistent leaderboard | `$5400-$630a` | Top-five ranking, name entry, screen rendering and disk storage code/data (`HIGHSCORES`) |

The linker configuration fixes the charset and sprite ranges. A build fails if
code grows into the reserved charset region or assets exceed their reserved
space. The two-byte PRG load-address header is listed at `$1bff-$1c00` by the
linker but does not occupy those runtime RAM addresses. The address-sorted map
is in `README.md`; the exact current segment ends come from
`build/nsshaft-c128.map`.

## Sprite allocation

| Sprite | Use |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Selected player; left preview on the title selector |
| 1 | Middle preview during title selection; otherwise free |
| 2 | Right preview during title selection; otherwise free |
| 3 | Free |
| 4 | Selected character's five-level direction/speed indicator |
| 5-7 | Free |

Each of the three characters has normal/fall/right/left/hurt plus fast-left and
fast-right bitmap blocks.
Elien's movement frames occupy `$3000-$30ff`; the other eleven blocks occupy
`$3a00-$3cbf`. The six fast-direction frames occupy `$3e80-$3fff` in character order.
Gameplay selects one of these 21 memory blocks through hardware sprite 0's
pointer; HUD sprite 4 reuses the same directional blocks. Only the selector
temporarily uses sprites 1 and 2.

## Important invariants

- Both screen buffers must contain the same sprite pointer values.
- `selected_character` is changed only by the title selector and intentionally
  survives `new_game`. Player and HUD frame lookups use it; text-only game-over
  pages keep game sprites disabled.
- Character-selection POTX thirds are 0..84, 85..170, and 171..255. The second
  FIRE requires the gameplay-neutral 108..148 range at press and after release.
  Off-center FIRE selects the character's hurt block
  for at least 12 frames, then requires another press.
- `active_screen` must match the screen selected in `$d018`.
- Layout transitions clear only the hidden playfield, then draw platform spans
  from three 20-byte row-indexed arrays: start, width, and canonical FULL code.
  Width zero marks an empty row; FULL encodes both material and fade/spring state.
  There is at most one platform per row, with blank rows separating platforms.
  Fixed UI cells and sprite pointers are already mirrored and are not cleared.
- `draw_platform` registers the description and preserves X for initial seeding.
  A scene clear resets all descriptions. Coarse scrolling shifts descriptions
  with score rows before rebuilding FULL spans and registering the new bottom row.
  Fade/spring effects update the descriptor before transforming both matrices;
  deleting a fade platform clears its width so it cannot reappear on a redraw.
  Collision remains screen-based; direct writes of platform cells alone are no
  longer sufficient to create persistent world geometry.
- Double buffering covers matrices only. Glyphs and Color RAM are shared, and
  `$d018` changes the selected matrix immediately rather than queuing a next-frame
  flip. Correct visible timing still requires checking the raster deadline.
- The status panel is never included in platform transitions or collision scans.
- Collision row pointers reuse the playfield low/high address tables. Sampled
  screen codes index a 68-byte collision-type table; UPPER fragments map to none.
- Score digits are written to both screen buffers. A parallel 20-byte row table
  moves with each coarse scroll and marks platforms claimed on first landing.
  Spike contact claims and scores the row before damage handling, so surviving
  or dying on the same spike cannot award it again.
  Scores 20/40/60/80 select 1.25x/1.5x/1.75x/2x speed. Rates through 224 use
  the phase accumulator; rate zero is the exact 256/256 every-frame sentinel.
- The same score-level index selects SID tempo increments 44/55/66/77/88. The
  music accumulator wraps at 512, so these are exact 1x/1.25x/1.5x/1.75x/2x
  ratios rather than rounded byte increments. Pitch tables never change.
- Platform-generation levels change at scores 5/10/20/40. Their weighted pools
  reduce normal's candidate-pool share from 75% to 12.5% while unlocking fade,
  conveyors, and spikes. Normal may repeat freely; every other type is rejected
  when it would be the third identical result in succession. Rejection changes
  the accepted distribution from the raw candidate weights.
- `HP:000` is mirrored to both buffers. Every third awarded platform increments
  HP, capped at 255, without changing score. Ordinary spike platforms consume HP and bounce the
  player; fixed ceiling spikes consume HP, cancel support/rise and drop the
  player by setting head Y to 81 (tip Y=73 plus 8), rather than subtracting from
  or adding to the previous Y. Either spike contact is fatal at zero HP;
  bottom exit always bypasses HP.
- The brick frame occupies rows 1/23 and columns 1/29/38. Frame 20 and normal
  platform 1 use multicolor red/white bricks; black rows outside the platform
  keep partial scrolling cells transparent-looking. White/green inverted spikes
  occupy row 2, columns 2..28. Only rows 3..22 scroll; HUD rows remain unchanged.
- Fixed geometry uses sprite-space screen origin Y=50, not the phase-biased
  platform base 43. Ceiling tips end at Y=73; the head touching that coordinate
  invokes ceiling damage. Carried motion and every spring-rise pixel test this
  immediately. Ceiling contact never awards score.
- Absorbed damage reloads a 16-update player-animation timer. While it is nonzero,
  the hurt block overrides movement animation. Otherwise any airborne state,
  including ascent, uses the fall frame; supported motion uses paddle-direction frames.
  Name-entry and leaderboard pages disable all game sprites.
- Disappearing platforms use intact red-brick/gray-mortar IDs 56/57/58 while
  idle, cracked IDs 7/16/17 immediately on activation, and broken IDs 59/60/61
  after 25 frames. Only the gray mortar erodes into black gaps; there is no
  color flashing. Test exact active-group membership, never a numeric interval.
  `fade_stage` selects cracked (0) or broken (1). `fade_platform_timer` starts
  at 50 and changes stage at 25; zero deletes the active platform, about one
  second when the main loop sustains PAL's 50 updates per second.
- Game output: bodies 1..7, fragments 8..19, frame 20, ceiling 21, free slots
  22..39, HUD text 40..55, extra fade variants 56..61, SCORE letters S/C/R/E
  at 62..65, conveyor lower fragments 66..67.
  See `src/charset_ids.inc` for slot definitions and the charset modules for composition.
- The direction indicator is sprite 4 pointing to the selected character's
  fast-left, left, normal, right or fast-right frame; no extra HUD glyphs are
  needed.
- D011=$1b disables ECM; D016=$18 enables mixed hires/multicolor text. Color RAM
  bit 3 selects each cell's mode. D021/D022/D023 are black/white/gray. Normal bricks
  and all fade stages use Color RAM=10; fade pairs 00/10/11 are black/gray/red.
  Springs use Color RAM=4 (purple). Conveyors use Color RAM=14 (8 | 6), with pairs 01/11 selecting
  white/blue; unused fragment rows stay black through pair 00.
- Fragment layouts use FULL-to-LOWER/UPPER tables once per platform span, not
  per screen cell. Complete layouts use the stored FULL code directly. Color
  writes cover occupied spans only: blank glyph 0 is black in both modes.
  Intermediate fine phases only rebuild glyph rows.
- Right conveyor cells use `$5f,$d7,$f5,$7d,$7d,$f5,$d7,$5f`; left cells use its
  horizontal mirror `$f5,$d7,$5f,$7d,$7d,$5f,$d7,$f5`. Mirroring reverses the four
  color pairs in each row without reversing the bits within a pair. Runtime
  `conveyor_left_pattern` and
  `conveyor_right_pattern` each hold eight mutable bytes; the source charset is
  unchanged. `conveyor_animation_counter` advances both textures by one color
  pair (two displayed pixels) every three frames, left and right respectively.
  Four horizontal phases repeat every 12 frames regardless of player support or
  whether the world scrolls that frame. Only the texture moves horizontally;
  platform boundaries and collision geometry do not.
- Conveyors keep independent FULL 5/6, UPPER 18/19 and LOWER 66/67 slots.
  Fragment rebuilding therefore cannot reshape still-visible FULL cells.
  Animation rebuilds UPPER/LOWER at the current vertical phase; before a
  completed coarse scroll becomes visible, FULL is restored from the current
  horizontal pattern, never the initial source phase.
- Modal entry copies the first 64 glyphs from source charset 2; TEXT_* uses
  standard C64 uppercase screen codes. No modal letters alias game fragments.
- New-game entry reconstructs the output from custom graphics plus only the
  20 HUD glyphs it needs. Source charsets are never overwritten; the display
  remains hidden during composition. No new per-frame copy or raster IRQ is used.
- Conveyor support is resolved inside the vertical collision state machine and
  uses an independent delay counter to push two pixels every three frames after
  the normal paddle movement.
- A compressed spring is transformed in both screen buffers and across the
  three-row transition window; walking off restores it without launching.
- `fine_scroll` describes custom-glyph transitions and is never written into
  `$d011`; that register stays at phase 3, keeping UI characters stationary.
- Player collision and sprite Y positions use the same
  `SCREEN_ROW0_BASE_Y + fine_scroll` coordinate model.
- Paddle movement and the direction sprite share the same neutral range 108..148.
  Movement still uses two speeds on each side, with thresholds 64 and 192.
- The music IRQ must not use shared zero-page scratch locations.
- Lead, bass and arpeggio patterns must each contain exactly 128 steps.
- The music segment must end before `$2e00`, where platform effects begin.
- `stop_music` leaves IRQs disabled and does not restore the previous IRQ vector;
  the next round installs the music handler again. Returning to BASIC would need
  a separate machine-state restoration path.
